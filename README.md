jQuery plugin for a simple horizontal showcase
==============================================
This no-frills horizontal-showcase want to be styled as YOU want (not as I want). So it has only 3-4 CSS rules.

The idea is to work without clown clothes.

See the local ```examples``` folder or see it online. It includes also the documentation:
